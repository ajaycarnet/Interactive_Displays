How to Use

Knowledge:
1.	Knowledge about Processing IDE
2.	Knowledge about embedded/Arduino programming

Prerequisites:
1.	Processing 2.2.x IDE installed on Windows 7+PC

Testing:
1.	Open Test.pde located inside test folder.
2.	Read the code and run the program to understand how it works.

Procedure:
1.	Now open SpeedOMeter.pde located in SpeedOMeter folder.
2.	Check for port and baud rate
3.	Change the value of divisor according to the maximum value in you code. Read the code for more details.
4.	Now run the code to see the indicator indicating the sensor value in analog speedometer way.
5.	Download the code and make changes according to your needs. Thank you have fun.

Usage:
1.	This is just an example how we can make a speedometer indicator for our Embedded or IoT projects.
2.	It uses serial communication for getting the data. We can change it to wireless communication for getting data.
3.	The best way of getting more out of it is taking the logic and develop in python environment.
